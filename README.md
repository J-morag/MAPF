# MAPF - Multi-Agent Path Finding
## A Java implementation of several MAPF algorithms

[![CI-tests](https://github.com/J-morag/MAPF/actions/workflows/CI-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/J-morag/MAPF_dev/actions/workflows/CI-tests.yml)
&emsp;[Continuous Benchmark](https://j-morag.github.io/MAPF/dev/bench/master/)

## Getting Started
### Running the project using the CLI

Example arguments to solve all instances in a directory, with 10 agents:<br>
`-a 10 -iDir <instances_path>`


* If compiling the code yourself:
  * Run the main function with the argument `-h` to see the available options.
* If running the code from a jar file:
  * Run the jar file with the argument `-h` to see the available options.
  * Example: `java -jar MAPF.jar -h`


The following algorithms are set to run by default: CBS and Prioritised Planning. 
Other algorithms can be selected using the `-s` flag. Use `-h` to see the available options.

The default instance format is from the [MovingAI benchmark](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/mapf/index.html).

### Running the project by modifying the code

Modify the `Main.java` file to run your experiment. Examples are provided in the `ExampleMain.java` file.

## Usage Notes

* How to create a single instance
    
        In order to create a single MAPF_Instance you will need:
        1. An InstanceManager
           public InstanceManager(I_InstanceBuilder instanceBuilder)
           1.1 Instance Builders parse instance files
                examples: 'InstanceBuilder_MovingAI', 'InstanceBuilder_BGU'
  
        2. An absolute path to the file, wrapped as an InstancePath object
        
        In the Environment.RunManagers.A_RunManager class there is a static method you can call:
        public static MAPF_Instance getInstanceFromPath(InstanceManager manager, 
                                                        InstanceManager.InstancePath absolutePath)
                                                        
* How to run single\multiple Experiments
        
        In order to run experiments you can use GenericRunManager.
        Alternatively, you can create you own RunManager class that extends Environment.RunManagers.A_RunManager, 
        and implements the following methods:
        1.  abstract void setSolvers(); // choose solvers to add (one or more)
            Example: solvers.add(new CBS_Solver())
            
        2.  abstract void setExperiments(); // choose experiments
            
            * You can view or modify the default report fields in method 'setReport'. 
            Add an Experiment class:
            public Experiment(String experimentName, InstanceManager instanceManager, int numOfInstances)
                2.1 Experiment name: give it a unique name, to differentiate between experiment
                2.2 An InstanceManager       
                    public InstanceManager(String sourceDirectory,
                                               I_InstanceBuilder instanceBuilder,
                                               InstanceProperties properties)
                    2.2.1   sourceDirectory - A path to the directory with the instances
                    2.2.2   Instance Builders  parse instance files
                            examples: 'InstanceBuilder_MovingAI', 'InstanceBuilder_BGU'
                    2.2.3   Instance Properties - In case you want to filter instances by criteria
                            Constructor:
                            @param mapSize - {@link MapDimensions} indicates the Axis lengths. 0 for unknown
                            @param obstacles - For unknown obstacles enter -1
                            @param numOfAgents - An array of different amounts of agents. 
            
                2.3 numOfInstances - You can choose how many instances you want for the experiment
                                     Note: default = unlimited
